# pet-feeder
Project Description
This project implements an automated pet feeding system using a Raspberry Pi and servo motors. Designed for pet owners who need to ensure their pets are fed at specific times, this system provides a reliable and programmable solution for dispensing pet food.
The system uses two servo-controlled "pod bay doors" to release food at a predetermined time. It's built with a Raspberry Pi as the control unit, making it both powerful and flexible for future enhancements.
Features

Dual Food Dispensers: The system controls two separate food dispensing mechanisms, allowing for multiple pets or meal types.
Precise Servo Control: Utilizes servo motors for accurate and reliable opening of food dispensers.
Scheduled Feeding: Currently set up for a specific date and time feeding schedule.
Manual Override: Includes functionality for manual closing of the food dispenser doors.
User Feedback: Provides console output to inform the user of the system's actions.
Safe Shutdown: Implements proper cleanup of GPIO resources on program exit.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for unexpected termination.

Future Enhancements
While the current system provides basic automated feeding functionality, there are several potential areas for expansion:

Implementing a repeatable, customizable feeding schedule
Adding a user interface for easy schedule modifications
Incorporating sensors for food level detection and successful dispenser operation
Enabling remote control and monitoring capabilities

This project serves as a solid foundation for an automated pet care system, with ample opportunity for additional features and improvements.
